Hello, world! This is an example text for tokenizer training.
Machine learning is transforming the way we interact with technology.
Natural language processing enables computers to understand human language.
Deep learning models require large amounts of training data.
Python is one of the most popular programming languages for AI development.
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return True
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(f"Even number: {i}")
    else:
        print(f"Odd number: {i}")
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
    def process(self):
        return [x * 2 for x in self.data]
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
data = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2, 3], 'col2': [4, 5, 6]})
result = data.groupby('col1').sum()
def calculate_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return calculate_fibonacci(n-1) + calculate_fibonacci(n-2)
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are revolutionizing industries.
Code completion models can predict the next lines of code based on context.
Fill-in-the-middle training helps models understand code structure better.
